# Tap Defense
Stop the attacking emojis before they reach the bottom of the screen! Tap an emoji image on the bottom of the screen to stop a falling emoji of the same type. But, if an emoji reaches the bottom of the screen or you tap the wrong image, you lose!

This is the third game I made, created with Pythonista for iOS sometime around 2015. In February 2019, I modified the code to be more efficient and work on screens of any size.
